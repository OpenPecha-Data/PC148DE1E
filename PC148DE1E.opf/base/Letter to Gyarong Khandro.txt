Letter to Gyarong Khandro

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Respectfully, I offer this before the diligent practitioner and queen of yoginīs, the great
Gyarong Khandro.

As the natural effect of the splendour of an ocean of twofold accumulation, you abide together
with many million wisdom ḍākinīs in your vajra dance and savour the many delights of the
joyous celebration of the supreme secret.

Supreme queen of adepts, when we arrived here we received your extensive gifts and learned of
your performing rituals for our long life, offering gaṇackara in major sacred places, and
sharing your prayers, aspirations and accomplishments, as well as performing profound and
vast rites for increasing positivity and dispelling inauspiciousness.

As a token of our gratitude for this inexpressible kindness, please accept this auspicious silk
scarf, and, to symbolize your three secrets remaining in the vajra nature, a bronze statue
of Tārā, textual fragments (glegs bu) from the profound termas of Lord Khyentse Wangpo,
a fine new vajra and bell set, and a pair of antique cymbals (ting shag) of excellent material.
Although these are of only little value, please accept them out of affection.

Great ḍākinī of the vajra family, may you remain forever on your vajra throne,Plant the seeds
of freedom through maturing and liberating an ocean of disciples, embodied and immaterial.Grant
the perfect celebration of happiness and joy for the teachings and all beings of the
land of Tibet.Shield us with your compassionate protection and sustain us with the nectar
of your blessings.

May dependent circumstances unfold without obstruction,So that we may behold your cheerful face
again in future,And savour the nectar of your speech.And virtue and excellence may blaze
with fierce intensity.

Sarva maṅgalam.
