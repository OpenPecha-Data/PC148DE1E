Namo guru!

Great ḍākinī, you are the embodiment of the compassion and blessings

Of the wisdom ḍākinī Mandāravā,

The space-consort of great bliss, Yeshe Tsogyal, and the rest—
dharma tsandré shyab la solwa deb
Dharmacandra,1 'Moon of Dharma', at your feet I pray!

lé ngen dikdrib dakpar jingyi lob
Grant your blessings so that I may purify all my negative karma, harmful actions and obscurations,
damtsik nyamchak nyetung tamché jang
And cleanse all impairments and breakages of samaya, violations, faults and downfalls!

yeshe khandro jinlab dak la shyuk
Wisdom ḍākinī, may your blessings fill my very being,
nyamtok rigpé tsal kha chokmé gyé
So that experience, realization and the power of rigpa develop boundlessly,
nedön jepur bötong dokpa dang
And all sickness, evil influences, sorcery and witchcraft are dispelled!

Dechen Wangmo, always hold me in your care,
tartuk pema ö kyi drongkhyer du
Until ultimately, in the city of Lotus Light,
sangwa yeshe tuk dang yermé shok
We become inseparable in the enlightened mind of secret wisdom!

At the request of the ḍākinī Tsering Chödrön, Chökyi Lodrö wrote these words of aspiration.
